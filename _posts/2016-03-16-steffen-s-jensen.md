# Steffen S. Jensen 

I'm a Graphic Designer from Denmark, and i have created digital and printed artwork since 2009\. With a case folder bigger than anyone at my age, with **300+ cases worldwide** including countries as: America, Canada, Australia, Vietnam, Iraq, Denmark, Germany, Austria, United Kingdome, Norway and Sweeden. 

I have been studying graphic design since the beginning 2011, and i'm not planing to stop any time soon. I have ben dedicated the whole time, and keep on working until i was happy with the finale result, witch have turned out to amazing experiences, and a 1 year job in Vietnam. 

Work aside. I enjoy Swimming, Dancing, Concerts...any kind of social activities, and singing out loud in public. 

Well, now that you know me a bit... I would love to hear if you are thinking about any projects or ideas that would be suitable for me, and if you do, then just drop me a message. 

(i'm a nice person, i promise)
